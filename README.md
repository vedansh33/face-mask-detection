# face-mask-detection
This helps us to check whether a particular person is wearing a face mask or not 
In these tough COVID-19 times I decided to built face mask detector 
to detect if you are wearing a face mask to protect yourself
by using pytorch and OPEN CV.
For building this model is used face mask dataset consisting of two files one to 
train data on and the second one to cross validate on ,Each file consisted of two more files
one file consisted of the photos with people wearing mask and the second file consisted of photos
with people not wearing masks.
For training the data I used transfer learning. I used an already trained model MobileNet V2 .
For getting more information about MobileNet V2 visit (https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04381).
I did my training on google collab that is I built my model on that .
Then for Real time face mask detection I used Open Cv on pycharm and
imported my model made on google collab to pycharm.
